This project enhances credit card fraud detection by addressing dataset imbalance using VAE, GAN, and VAE-GAN to generate synthetic fraud samples. Models are evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, aiming to improve detection performance and reliability.

"Project Summary"

This project focuses on enhancing credit card fraud detection by addressing the challenge of highly imbalanced datasets, where fraudulent transactions are extremely rare compared to legitimate ones. The study uses the European Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle, which contains over 280,000 transactions with only 0.17% labeled as fraud. To overcome the imbalance problem, generative artificial intelligence techniques—specifically Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and a hybrid VAE-GAN—are applied to generate realistic synthetic fraud samples. These synthetic samples are combined with anomaly detection methods and classical machine learning models such as Random Forest and One-Class SVM to improve detection accuracy. The models are evaluated using metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a particular emphasis on F1-score due to the dataset’s imbalance. Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn are used for model development, with Google Colab providing collaborative development and GPU resources. The results aim to demonstrate that incorporating VAE-GAN-based synthetic data significantly improves the performance and reliability of fraud detection systems.
